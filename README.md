Overview
--------

The [Flag][1] module has one omission: when an item is flagged by
several users (assuming it's a non-global flag), there's no easy way to
clear all these flaggings at once. This module provides a "Reset link"
field for Views for doing this.

Note: This module does **not** display this link under each node, but
you can install the [Custom Links][2] module to achieve this: set your
link to `flag/reset/bookmarks/[nid]` (replace `bookmarks` with the name
of your flag).

This module also provides a "Remove flagging" link, for Views, for
clearing [a specific flagging][3].

Requirements
------------

You must use Flag 2.x. This module is not compatible with Flag 1.x.

Usage
-----

After enabling this module you'll find two new pseudo fields in your
Views admin interface:

  `Flag: Reset link`

This removes all the flaggings for this item. This field sits on the
"Flag counter" relationship (because it wants to know whether anybody
has flagged this item), so **you'll have to bring in this counter
relationship first**.

  `Flag: Remove link`

This removes a single flagging (The "relationship" record).

Users have to have the "administer flags" permission to be able to use
these links.

(And see the note above, about Custom Links, for displaying a reset link
under each node.)
