After enabling this module you'll find two new pseudo fields in your
Views admin inteface:

  Flag: Remove link

This removes a single flagging (The "relationship" record).

  Flag: Reset link

This removes all the flagging for this content id. This field sits on
the "Flag counter" relationship so you'll have to bring it in first.
